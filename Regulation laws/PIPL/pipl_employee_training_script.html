    <h1>EMPLOYEE TRAINING SCRIPT (PIPL)</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction to PIPL</h2>
    <p><strong>Trainer:</strong> "Welcome. Today we are training on China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which took effect on November 1, 2021. This law gives individuals significant rights over their data and imposes strict obligations on us. Non-compliance can lead to severe penalties, including fines of up to 5% of annual revenue and personal liability for decision-makers:cite[5]."</p>
    
    <h2>2. The Golden Rule: Obtaining Valid Consent</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Trainer:</strong> "This is the most critical point. Under PIPL, consent must be <strong>voluntary, explicit, and made with full knowledge</strong>. Most importantly, 'bundled consent'—where a user agrees to everything in one click—is <strong>illegal</strong>:cite[4]:cite[9].
        
        <strong>What you must do:</strong>
        • For sensitive data, cross-border transfers, or data sharing, you must obtain <strong>'Separate Consent'</strong>.
        • This means a clear, standalone 'yes' for each specific purpose, with no pre-checked boxes.
        • If the purpose of processing changes, we must go back and get fresh consent."
    </div>
    
    <h2>3. Identifying Sensitive Personal Information (SPI)</h2>
    <p><strong>Trainer:</strong> "SPI includes biometrics, religious beliefs, medical health, financial accounts, location tracking, and the personal information of minors under 14:cite[9]. Handling SPI triggers stricter requirements, including a mandatory <strong>Personal Information Protection Impact Assessment (PIPIA)</strong>. If your project involves SPI, you must flag it immediately to the Data Protection Officer."</p>
    
    <h2>4. When is a PIPIA Required?</h2>
    <p><strong>Trainer:</strong> "A PIPIA is mandatory in the following scenarios:cite[5]:cite[9]:
        • Processing sensitive personal information;
        • Using personal information for automated decision-making (e.g., profiling);
        • Entrusting the processing, sharing, or publicly disclosing personal information;
        • Transferring personal information outside of China.
        If your project involves any of these, a PIPIA must be completed and documented before proceeding."</p>
    
    <h2>5. Respecting Individual Rights</h2>
    <p><strong>Trainer:</strong> "We must be prepared to act on data subject requests. If someone asks to access, correct, delete, or withdraw consent for their data, you must know the procedure. Direct these requests to [Designated Contact/Department] immediately. We have a legal obligation to respond in a timely manner:cite[4]:cite[5]."</p>
    
    <h2>6. Data Breach Response</h2>
    <p><strong>Trainer:</strong> "If you suspect a data breach—data lost, leaked, or stolen—you must report it internally <strong>immediately</strong>. The company is legally required to notify the authorities and, in some cases, the affected individuals. Time is of the essence:cite[5]."</p>
