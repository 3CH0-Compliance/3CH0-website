        <h2>1. What is HIPAA?</h2>
        <p><strong>Trainer:</strong> "HIPAA is a federal law that establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.</p>
        <p>The HIPAA Privacy Rule sets standards for how we can use and disclose Protected Health Information (PHI).</p>
        <p>The HIPAA Security Rule establishes national standards to protect electronic PHI."</p>

            <p><em>(Answer: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)</em></p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. What is Protected Health Information (PHI)?</h2>
        <p><strong>Trainer:</strong> "PHI is any information that can identify a patient and relates to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Their past, present, or future physical or mental health</li>
            <li>The provision of health care to the individual</li>
            <li>Payment for the provision of health care</li>
        </ul>
        <p>PHI includes common identifiers like name, address, birth date, Social Security Number, and medical record number."</p>
        
        <div class="quiz">
            <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A patient's name and diagnosis appear together on a document. Is this PHI?</p>
            <p><em>(Answer: Yes, this is PHI because it contains identifiable health information)</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Permitted Uses and Disclosures</h2>

    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Minimum Necessary Standard</h2>
        <p><strong>Trainer:</strong> "When using, disclosing, or requesting PHI, we must make reasonable efforts to limit the information to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose.</p>
        <p>For example, when sending records to another provider for treatment, only send what is relevant to that treatment."</p>
        
        <div class="quiz">
            <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A colleague asks to see a patient's entire medical record out of curiosity. Should you provide it?</p>
            <p><em>(Answer: No, this violates the minimum necessary standard unless there is a legitimate work-related need)</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>

        <p><strong>Trainer:</strong> "We all share responsibility for protecting PHI:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Never discuss patient information in public areas</li>
            <li>Secure paper records - don't leave them unattended</li>
            <li>Log out of computer systems when stepping away</li>
            <li>Use secure methods when transmitting PHI</li>
            <li>Shred documents containing PHI before disposal</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Report it immediately to your supervisor or our Privacy Officer</li>
            <li>Do not attempt to investigate on your own</li>
            <li>Document what you observed without accessing additional PHI</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We have a non-retaliation policy - you will not face consequences for reporting in good faith."</p>
