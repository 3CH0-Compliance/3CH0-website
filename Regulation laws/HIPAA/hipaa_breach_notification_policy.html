    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
        <p>This policy establishes procedures for identifying, investigating, and responding to breaches of unsecured Protected Health Information (PHI) in compliance with the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule. {{1.company}} is committed to protecting the privacy and security of all PHI and to promptly notifying affected individuals, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and when required, the media, in the event of a breach.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Scope</h2>
        <p>This policy applies to all workforce members of {{1.company}}, including employees, volunteers, trainees, contractors, and any other persons whose conduct is under the direct control of {{1.company}}. This policy also applies to all Business Associates through their Business Associate Agreements.</p>

        <h2>3. Definitions</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 Breach</h3>
        <p>The acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of PHI in a manner not permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule which compromises the security or privacy of the PHI.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Presumption of Breach:</strong> An impermissible use or disclosure of PHI is presumed to be a breach unless {{1.company}} demonstrates that there is a low probability that the PHI has been compromised based on a risk assessment.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>3.2 Unsecured PHI</h3>
        <p>PHI that is not rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized persons through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Using an algorithmic process that meets NIST standards</li>
            <li><strong>Destruction:</strong> Paper records shredded or destroyed; electronic media cleared, purged, or destroyed per NIST guidelines</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Compromise</h3>
        <p>The PHI is compromised when its security or privacy has been placed at risk.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Breach Risk Assessment</h2>

                <td><strong>2. Unauthorized Person</strong></td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>3. Actual Acquisition/Viewing</strong></td>

        <div class="key-point">
